  <h1>Loan Policy & Terms</h1>

  <p>
    The Bank Loan System follows structured policies to ensure fairness,
    transparency, and compliance with standard banking practices. Every loan
    application is evaluated based on predefined eligibility criteria and
    risk assessment rules.
  </p>

  <h3>Eligibility Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Applicants must be at least <strong>21 years old</strong> and have a stable
    source of income. Eligibility is determined by income level, existing EMIs,
    and a simulated credit score range. Meeting eligibility criteria does not
    guarantee approval.
  </p>

  <h3>Interest Rate Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Interest rates vary depending on loan type and tenure. Secured loans such as
    home loans generally have lower interest rates compared to personal loans.
    The applicable interest rate is displayed during loan application to avoid
    hidden charges.
  </p>

  <h3>EMI & Repayment Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Loan repayment is done through <strong>Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs)</strong>.
    EMIs include both principal and interest components. Timely EMI payment is
    mandatory, and late payments may attract penalties.
  </p>

  <h3>Documentation Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Valid documents such as identity proof, address proof, and income proof must
    be submitted. Additional documents may be required based on the loan type.
    Applications with incomplete or invalid documents may be delayed or rejected.
  </p>
  <h3>Approval & Rejection Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Loan applications pass through stages such as <strong>Submitted, Under Review,
    Approved, or Rejected</strong>. Approval decisions depend on eligibility,
    document verification, and internal assessment rules.
