  <h1>About Bank Loan System</h1>

  <p>
    The Bank Loan System is a web-based application developed to simulate real-world
    banking operations using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. It demonstrates how digital banking platforms manage loan
    processing efficiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system provides role-based access for customers and bank officers, allowing
    loan applications, approvals, repayments, and reporting to be managed
    effectively. It includes dashboards, notifications, and activity logs for
    better transparency.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project is designed to be scalable and future-ready, with scope for
    enhancements such as mobile responsiveness, multilingual support, advanced
    security, and integration with backend services.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bank Loan System showcases how technology can improve banking services by
    offering faster processing, better customer experience, and efficient
    financial management.
